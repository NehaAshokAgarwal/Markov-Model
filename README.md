# Markov-Model
Implemented the Markovian chain model to predict who is more likely to have said the provided quote by predicting the pattern of the words provided in the given file dataset. 
This project is related to my Advanced Algorithm class at UMB. 
In this problem, I am looking at the given data set file to predict who is likely to say the given quote. 
This project is taken from the Princeton Creative assignment website - "Markovian Candidate".
Thank you!
